# Bachelors Final Year Project Content Based Image Retrieval

Content-based image recovery (CBIR) is an important and progressively popular approach that supports in the recovery of image data from a large collection. The proposed system consists of feature extraction, image recovery, image comparison
and relevant comments. In our work, we have used the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for feature representation and to compare similarities. The algorithms used are Discrete Wavelet Transform and Convolution Neural Network have the potential
to perform efficiently in terms of average precision and recall values. The mentioned retrieval algorithm has minimized the computation time and has increased users in- teraction.

This work can be further used in some domain-based applications such as finger print recognition, retina identification, and object detection for large image database. Also the feature extraction in wavelet transform is done sequentially in our project. It can be optimized by using parallel method for feature extraction. Extension for this project can be in Content Based Video Retrieval.

Goals and Objectives
The objectives of this study are:
1. To find the attributes of the images using feature extraction.
2. To check the resemblance of the images using a similarity check.
